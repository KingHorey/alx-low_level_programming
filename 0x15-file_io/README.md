FILE DESCRIPTORS

Summary: For the computer to work on files, it loads the saved content from the local disk to the ram and ten works with it from there.

However, the result is on the volatile memory and needs to be stored back to the local storage.  FIle descriptors help with this.

This repository contains tasks on:

->> file creation using open()

->> Appending to a file

NB: DO feel free to reach out if there are other ways the code could be better refactored! cheers!!
